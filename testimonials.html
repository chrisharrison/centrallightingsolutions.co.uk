                        gives me a competitive quote and gets the work done with the minimum amount of fuss. I would have no hesitation in recommending their service.</p>

                    <p>St Austell Brewery Co Ltd has worked with Paul at Central Lighting since the company was conceived.
                        Paul responds to our many and varied demands that we ask of him quickly and professionally in a timely 
                        fashion. Paul has health and safety as a high priority and works in accordance with our site policies 
                        at all times.</p>
                    <p>Central Lighting offers us solutions to issues that we have to address on all aspects of lighting 
                        whenever we ask for their advice. We find Central Lighting a competitive solution to all aspects of 
                        lighting maintenance, lamp replacement and emergency lighting checks.</p>
                    <p>I personally would recommend Paul at Central Lighting to any company wishing to find a competitive 
                        commercial lighting maintenance and supply solution.</p>

                    <p>At Stennack Surgery we have used the services of Paul Clarke for several years to help maintain
                    our various lights and lamps around the building. Paul has always offered an excellent service, with
                    a quick response to our various lighting problems, be they big or small. He is efficient, helpful
                    and discreet whilst working within the Practice. We would have no problem in recommending his
                    services.</p>

                    <p>Central Lighting Solutions can be relied upon to plan, supply, install and maintain with no fuss, 
                    all we have to do is specify our requirements and with minimum consultation they just get on with it.</p>
                    <p>They offer advice on energy efficiencies and recommend the best solutions for our business.</p>
                    <p>Their service is very competitive and more cost effective than having our own engineers carry out the work.</p>
